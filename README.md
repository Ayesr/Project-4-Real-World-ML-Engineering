# Project-4-Predictive-Maintenance-using-MLOps
An end-to-end production engineering pipeline designed to monitor industrial asset telemetry and predict equipment failures using a Random Forest framework. It integrates MLflow for robust model  version control, deployment tracking while implementing secure skops deserialization to satisfy enterprise data governance and CVE safety constraints.

A secure, automated machine learning lifecycle pipeline using **MLflow** for model governance and **Skops** for secure production deployment of a predictive maintenance asset classifier.

## 🚀 System Pipeline Features
* **Experiment Tracking:** Centralized metric logging with MLflow.
* **Metadata & Governance:** Models are tracked with descriptive version tags (`team`, `validation_status`, `framework`).
* **Stage Management:** Automated promotion transitions through `Staging` and `Production` with version aliases.
* **Security Layer:** Built entirely using `skops` instead of insecure `pickle` files to satisfy modern **CVE-2024-37065** safety parameters.
* **Rollback Architecture:** Safe rollback switches back from failed versions to known historical dependencies inside the model registry.

##  Core Pipeline Code Ledger

### 1. Model Registry Governance & Staging Promotion
Sets up client tracking configs, stamps organizational tags, and safely builds the model instance into active notebook memory using secure type inspection.

## Key Infrastructure Milestones
- Centralized Lifecycle Tracking: Handles absolute file routing bypasses on Windows (C:\Users\Ayesha\mlartifacts\) to completely eliminate local server network path mismatch crashes ([WinError 123]).

- Automated Stage Routing: Configures structural tags and points modern @staging and @production lookup pointers directly to verified container iterations.

- Enterprise Compliance Layer: Replaces insecure pickle engines with skops.io structural pre-scans, protecting runtime servers from arbitrary code execution exploits.

- Resilient Failure Recovery: Automatically handles rollback mechanics to shift pipeline deployment routes away from failed candidate models and lock back onto steady historical versions instantaneously.
